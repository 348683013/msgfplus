**Describe the question or problem**
A clear and concise question.

**Details**
Add any other details about the question or problem here, e.g. if it is a question about MS-GF+ results, add some relevant data here, like "I got result X when I was expecting result Y because of ...". A one-sentence question with just the MS-GF+ command line is not enough detail to provide a good response.

**Useful extras**
* Command line command used to run MS-GF+
* Output of 'java --version'
